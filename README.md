WebNote is a lightweight, browser-based notes and to-do list application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes, attach images, add tags, and prioritize tasks. The app also includes a simple to-do list manager with deadlines and priority labels, making it a convenient all-in-one productivity tool.
